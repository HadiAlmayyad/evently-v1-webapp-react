# Evently - "Eventually, You Will Use Evently"

## Description:
KFUPM hosts a wide variety of events throughout the year, offering valuable opportunities for students, faculty, and businesses to engage in academic, social, and professional activities. However, the current event management system has several inefficiencies. Event announcements are primarily sent via email, resulting in cluttered inboxes and overlooked invitations. Additionally, last-minute notifications provide minimal time for attendees to prepare, and there is no centralized platform to track past and upcoming events.

To address these issues, we developed **Evently** – the KFUPM Event Management System. Evently is a web-based platform designed to streamline event organization and participation. It enables event organizers to create, edit, and customize events, while attendees can browse events, RSVP, and receive real-time notifications. The platform also includes filtering options to help users find events based on type, location, or date. By enhancing accessibility, reducing communication delays, and centralizing event management, **Evently** improves the event experience for everyone at KFUPM.

## Setup and Installation:

To get started with **Evently**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KenanKaddoura/Evently-v1-webApp-react
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Evently-v1-webApp-react
   
3. Install dependencies and start the app:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
  The application should now be running locally at http://localhost:3000.
